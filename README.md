# Customer Clustering

## Project Overview
This project applies **unsupervised machine learning** techniques to segment customers based on demographics and spending behaviour. By identifying distinct customer groups, the analysis enables more effective **marketing strategies**, **personalised recommendations**, and **resource allocation**.

## ðŸ›  Features
- **Data Preprocessing & Cleaning**
  - Checked for missing and duplicated data
  - Created dummy variables
  - Removed outliers
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**
  - Univariate & bivariate analysis
  - Feature scaling for clustering algorithms
- **Clustering Models**
  - **K-Means**
  - **Agglomerative Clustering**
  - **DBSCAN**
- **Model Evaluation**
  - Cluster profiling & interpretation
  - Reverse scaling for real-world insights

## Key Insights
- **Cluster 0**: Lowest income group with lowest spending  
- **Cluster 1**: Younger demographic with moderate income and spending  
- **Cluster 2**: High income and high spending  
- **Cluster 3**: High income with low spending  
- **Cluster 4**: Older demographic with moderate income and spending  
- **Cluster 5**: Low income with high spending  

## Business Implications
- Identify **premium customers** for loyalty programs
- Develop **targeted promotions** for low-spending high-income segments
- Tailor products for **age-based preferences**

## Tech Stack
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)
- **Jupyter Notebook** for development and analysis
